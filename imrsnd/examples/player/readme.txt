IMRSND Player Example

This example demonstrates the functionallity for the Audio and MIDI players.
Currently, the player supports the following file formats:

Wave '*.wav' audio files.
MIDI (*.mid) files.

We hope to add support for more audio file formats.

The program should be already compiled inside the 'bin' folder.
If you want to recompile it, just type:

make

To run the 'prog.exe' program, you must execute
the 'run.sh' script if you are in a Linux like shell,
or 'run.bat' if you are under a Windows command line shell.

Linux:
./run.sh

Windows:
run

In the 'bin' folder, there are some wave and midi files to test.
