### *Audio and MIDI*  
  
    
    This development covers the following concepts:  
>  
> - Audio: Storage, recording and playback.  
> - Audio file formats currently supported:  
> - Wave ( *.wav ).  
> - MIDI: Storage and playback.  
>  
      
	The idea is to add more features, since this is the first attempt of implementing such a library. We expect,  
for instance, adding support for MP3 storage and for other audio file formats. We would like to manage MIDI input too,  
since at this moment there are just support for MIDI output; well, we can say that there is some support for MIDI input  
in storage by loading SMF ( Standard MIDI File ).  
The language that we decided to use is C++, because it is an excellent object oriented programming language, and enables scalability to our project.  
With this implementation, several OOP concepts are demonstrated: Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism... inmutable objects and mor.  
The audience for this work that we expect are people interested in how to program low level sound applications for Windows, but the skills and C++  
concepts are independent of any platform so, we think that they can be adapted in other platforms like Linux.  
If the reader finds this work interesting, we encourage you to join it and share ideas to improve it by refactoring and add extra features.
